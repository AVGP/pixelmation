# Pixelmation
## Make animated pixel art GIFs in your browser

## What's this?
This project allows you to create animated pixel art on a 16x16 pixel canvas and export it as an animated GIF.
A resulting GIF may look like this:

![Stupid pixel gif](http://i.imgur.com/s4euaQc.gif)

## How does it work?
You may draw pixels onto a `<canvas>` element and save them as a frame in the [GIF encoder](https://github.com/antimatter15/jsgif).
The frame is then reset and you can draw a new frame.

When you're done, hit "Encode" and you'll get your animated GIF :)

Have fun pixeling!
